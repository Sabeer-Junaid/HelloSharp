1. The program prompts the user to enter marks for three subjects: English, Math, and Urdu.  
2. It reads the user input and converts the values from string to integer using `Convert.ToInt32()`.  
3. The total marks are calculated by summing up the three subject marks.  
4. The program calls the `Avg()` method, passing the total marks and the number of subjects (3) as arguments.  
5. The `Avg()` method calculates the average by dividing the total marks by the number of subjects and returns a `double` value.  
6. The average is rounded to the nearest whole number using `Math.Round()`.  
7. The final rounded average is displayed on the console using `Console`
